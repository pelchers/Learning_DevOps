- **Decision guidance** - Understand when and why to use different technology combinations
- **Progressive complexity** - Follow the natural evolution from simple tools to enterprise systems

**📈 Learning Progression:**
1. **Foundation** - Git/GitHub as the backbone of all DevOps practices
2. **Development** - How local development environments integrate with version control
3. **Containerization** - Docker's role bridging development and production
4. **Automation** - CI/CD pipelines as the orchestration layer
5. **Enterprise** - Complex relationships in large-scale production systems

**🔄 Integration with Main Learning Path:**
- **Before studying a module** - Read the corresponding relationship guide for context
- **During module study** - Reference how technologies connect to others you've learned
- **After module completion** - Review how the technology fits into broader systems

**💡 Unique Features:**
- **Visual diagrams** showing technology connections and data flows
- **Real-world scenarios** from simple websites to enterprise microservices
