# 🚀 DevOps Overview - Understanding the Foundation

## 🎯 What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a cultural and technical movement that brings together **Development** (Dev) and **Operations** (Ops) teams to improve collaboration, increase deployment frequency, and deliver more reliable software faster.

### **Core Definition:**
DevOps is **not just tools** - it's a combination of:
- **Culture** - Collaborative mindset between development and operations
- **Practices** - Methodologies like continuous integration and deployment
- **Tools** - Technologies that enable automation and monitoring
- **Philosophy** - Focus on speed, quality, and reliability simultaneously

## 🏗️ The DevOps Lifecycle

DevOps follows a continuous cycle of improvement:

```
Plan → Code → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → Plan...
```

### **Each Phase Explained:**

1. **Plan** 📋 - Requirements gathering and project planning
2. **Code** 💻 - Writing and version controlling application code
3. **Build** 🔨 - Compiling code and creating deployable artifacts
4. **Test** 🧪 - Automated testing for quality assurance
5. **Release** 📦 - Preparing code for deployment
6. **Deploy** 🚀 - Releasing code to production environments
7. **Operate** ⚙️ - Managing production systems and applications
8. **Monitor** 📊 - Tracking performance and gathering feedback
