## What to Review

### Code Quality Checklist

#### 1. Functionality
```javascript
// Good: Clear function purpose
function calculateTotalPrice(items, taxRate) {
  return items.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price, 0) * (1 + taxRate);
}

// Review: Consider edge cases
function calculateTotalPrice(items, taxRate) {
  if (!items || items.length === 0) return 0;
  if (taxRate < 0 || taxRate > 1) throw new Error('Invalid tax rate');
  
  return items.reduce((total, item) => {
    if (typeof item.price !== 'number' || item.price < 0) {
      throw new Error('Invalid item price');
    }
    return total + item.price;
  }, 0) * (1 + taxRate);
}
```

#### 2. Security
```python
# Bad: SQL injection vulnerability
def get_user(user_id):
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
    return db.execute(query)

# Good: Parameterized query
def get_user(user_id):
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
    return db.execute(query, (user_id,))

# Review checklist:
# - Input validation
# - SQL injection prevention
# - XSS prevention
# - Authentication/authorization
# - Data encryption
# - Logging security events
```

#### 3. Performance
```python
# Bad: N+1 query problem
def get_users_with_orders():
    users = User.objects.all()
    for user in users:
        user.orders = Order.objects.filter(user_id=user.id)
    return users

# Good: Optimized query
def get_users_with_orders():
    return User.objects.prefetch_related('orders').all()

# Review considerations:
# - Database queries
# - Algorithm complexity
# - Memory usage
# - Network calls
# - Caching opportunities
```

#### 4. Error Handling
```javascript
// Bad: Silent failures
function processPayment(amount) {
  try {
    return paymentService.charge(amount);
  } catch (error) {
    return null;
  }
}

// Good: Proper error handling
function processPayment(amount) {
  try {
    if (amount <= 0) {
      throw new Error('Payment amount must be positive');
    }
    return paymentService.charge(amount);
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Payment processing failed', { amount, error: error.message });
    throw new PaymentError(`Failed to process payment: ${error.message}`);
  }
}
```

### Architecture Review Points

#### 1. Design Patterns
```python
# Review: Is the right pattern being used?
class PaymentProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.strategies = {
            'credit_card': CreditCardStrategy(),
            'paypal': PayPalStrategy(),
            'bank_transfer': BankTransferStrategy()
        }
    
    def process_payment(self, method, amount):
        if method not in self.strategies:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported payment method: {method}")
        return self.strategies[method].process(amount)
```

#### 2. Dependency Management
```typescript
// Bad: Tight coupling
class UserService {
  constructor() {
    this.database = new MySQLDatabase();
    this.emailService = new SMTPEmailService();
  }
}

// Good: Dependency injection
class UserService {
  constructor(
    private database: Database,
    private emailService: EmailService
  ) {}
}
```

## Common Review Pitfalls

### 1. Reviewer Pitfalls

#### Nitpicking
```markdown
## Avoid: Excessive Style Comments
❌ "Use spaces instead of tabs"
❌ "This should be on the same line"
❌ "Prefer single quotes over double quotes"

## Better: Use Automated Tools
✅ Configure Prettier/ESLint to handle formatting
✅ Focus on logic, architecture, and functionality
✅ Reserve style comments for consistency issues
```

#### Rushed Reviews
```markdown
## Signs of Rushed Reviews
- Approval within minutes of large PRs
- No questions or comments
- Missing obvious issues
- Generic "LGTM" comments

## Better Approach
- Allocate appropriate time
- Use review checklists
- Ask clarifying questions
- Provide specific feedback
```

### 2. Author Pitfalls

#### Defensive Responses
```markdown
## Avoid Defensive Reactions
❌ "This is how we've always done it"
❌ "The reviewer doesn't understand the requirements"
❌ "It's too late to change this now"

## Better Responses
✅ "Thanks for the feedback, let me explain my reasoning..."
✅ "That's a good point, I'll make that change"
✅ "I disagree because... what do you think?"
```

#### Large PRs
```markdown
## Problems with Large PRs
- Reviewer fatigue
- Reduced review quality
- Longer review cycles
- Merge conflicts

## Solutions
- Break features into smaller PRs
