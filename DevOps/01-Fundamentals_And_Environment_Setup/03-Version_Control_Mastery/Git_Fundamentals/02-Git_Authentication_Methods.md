# 🔐 Git Authentication Methods for Team Collaboration

## 📖 What This File Does
This guide covers all authentication methods for Git operations in team environments, from small development teams to large enterprise organizations. It explains how to securely connect to repositories using Personal Access Tokens (PATs), SSH keys, and GitHub CLI.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand different Git authentication methods and when to use each
- Set up Personal Access Tokens for HTTPS operations
- Configure SSH keys for secure, password-free authentication
- Use GitHub CLI for modern authentication workflows
- Apply security best practices for team environments
- Troubleshoot common authentication issues

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Git installed and configured (see `01-Git_Installation_And_Setup.md`)
- GitHub account with repository access
- Basic understanding of command-line operations

---

## 🔍 **Authentication Context: Why This Matters for Teams**

### **📋 The Authentication Challenge**

When you're added as a collaborator to a team repository, **Git needs to verify your identity** every time you:
- Clone a repository
- Push commits
- Pull updates
- Access private repositories

**🚨 Critical Change:** GitHub **discontinued password authentication** in August 2021 for security reasons. You **cannot** use your GitHub account password for Git operations anymore.

### **⚡ Three Modern Authentication Methods**

| Method | Best For | Security Level | Setup Difficulty | Team Usage |
|--------|----------|----------------|------------------|------------|
| **Personal Access Tokens (PATs)** | Getting started quickly | Good | Easy | ✅ Universal |
| **SSH Keys** | Daily development work | Excellent | Medium | ✅ Developer favorite |
| **GitHub CLI** | Modern GitHub workflows | Excellent | Easy | ✅ Best GitHub integration |

---

## 🎫 **Personal Access Tokens (PATs) - HTTPS Authentication**

### **📋 What are Personal Access Tokens?**

**Personal Access Tokens** are secure alternatives to passwords that:
- **Replace your GitHub password** for Git operations
- **Have specific permissions** (you control what they can access)
- **Can expire** (better security than permanent passwords)
- **Are unique per user** (each team member creates their own)

### **🔧 Creating Your First PAT**

#### **Step 1: Generate PAT on GitHub**
```bash
# Navigate to GitHub in your browser:
# GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
# 
# OR use this direct link:
# https://github.com/settings/tokens
```

1. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
2. **Note**: Give it a descriptive name like `"Team Development - [Your Computer]"`
3. **Expiration**: Choose 30-90 days (security best practice)
4. **Select scopes** for team work:

#### **🎯 Required Scopes for Team Collaboration**
```
✅ repo                    # Full repository access (required for private repos)
✅ workflow               # Update GitHub Actions workflows
✅ write:packages         # Publish packages (if your team uses them)
✅ read:org               # Read organization membership (for org repos)
⚠️ admin:repo_hook       # Only if you manage webhooks
❌ delete_repo           # Usually not needed for team members
❌ admin:org             # Only for organization administrators
```

5. Click **"Generate token"**
6. **⚠️ CRITICAL:** Copy the token immediately - you won't see it again!

#### **Step 2: Use PAT for Git Operations**

```bash
# Method 1: Use PAT when prompted
git clone https://github.com/company/team-project.git
# Username: your-github-username
# Password: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx  # ← Your PAT, not GitHub password!

# Method 2: Embed PAT in URL (less secure, avoid for shared systems)
git clone https://your-username:ghp_your-token@github.com/company/team-project.git

# Method 3: Use credential helper (stores PAT securely)
git config --global credential.helper store
git clone https://github.com/company/team-project.git
# Enter PAT once, Git remembers it
```

### **🔄 PAT Workflow Example**

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as Developer
    participant GitHub as GitHub.com
    participant Local as Local Repository
    participant Team as Team Repository
    
    Dev->>GitHub: Create PAT with 'repo' scope
    GitHub->>Dev: Return token: ghp_xxxxx
    
    Dev->>Team: git clone https://github.com/company/project.git
    Team->>Dev: Request authentication
    Dev->>Team: Username + PAT (instead of password)
    Team->>Local: Repository cloned successfully
    
    Dev->>Local: git add . && git commit
    Dev->>Team: git push origin feature-branch
    Team->>Team: PAT verified, push accepted ✅
    
    Note over Dev: PAT enables all Git operations
    Note over GitHub: PAT can be rotated/revoked anytime
```

---

## 🔑 **SSH Keys - Developer's Preferred Method**

### **📋 What are SSH Keys?**

**SSH Keys** provide **password-free authentication** using cryptographic key pairs:
- **Private key** stays on your computer (never share)
- **Public key** goes to GitHub (safe to share)
- **No passwords** needed once set up
- **More secure** than password-based authentication

### **🔧 SSH Key Setup for Team Work**

#### **👔 Manager/Admin Responsibilities vs 👨‍💻 Team Member Responsibilities**

**🎯 Understanding the Division of Setup Tasks:**

| Responsibility | Manager/Admin | Team Member |
|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Repository Setup** | ✅ Create repositories | ❌ |
| **Team Access Management** | ✅ Add collaborators with write permissions | ❌ |
| **Organization Policies** | ✅ Set SSH key requirements | ❌ |
| **Security Policies** | ✅ Define key rotation schedule | ❌ |
| **SSH Key Generation** | ❌ | ✅ Generate personal SSH key |
| **Public Key Management** | ❌ | ✅ Add public key to GitHub |
| **Local SSH Configuration** | ❌ | ✅ Configure local SSH agent |

#### **👔 What Managers/Admins Set Up (One-Time Team Setup)**

```bash
# Manager/Admin tasks (done once per team/project):

# 1. Create organization/team repositories
# GitHub UI: Create repository → Set to private → Configure branch protection

# 2. Set organization SSH security policies
# GitHub Organization Settings → Authentication security
# - Require SSH key authentication for Git operations
# - Set key rotation requirements (e.g., every 90 days)
# - Enable audit logging for SSH key usage

# 3. Add team members as collaborators
# Repository Settings → Manage access → Invite collaborators
# - Grant "Write" permissions for developers
# - Grant "Admin" permissions for senior developers/leads

# 4. Configure organization-wide security requirements
# GitHub Organization Settings → Member privileges
# - Require two-factor authentication
# - Set SSH key expiration policies
# - Configure IP allow lists (if using VPN/office networks)

# 5. Document team SSH key standards
# Create team wiki/documentation with:
# - Required key types (Ed25519 preferred)
# - Naming conventions for SSH keys
# - Key rotation schedule
# - Emergency access procedures
```

    style I fill:#e8f5e8
    style J fill:#e8f5e8
```

#### **👨‍💻 What Team Members Set Up (Individual Setup)**

**⚠️ Important:** Team members **cannot** add themselves to repositories. They must wait for manager/admin to add them as collaborators first.

#### **Step 1: Generate SSH Key Pair (Team Member)**

```bash
# Generate SSH key with your email
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@company.com"

# If ed25519 is not supported (older systems):
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your-email@company.com"

# When prompted:
# - File location: Press Enter (use default ~/.ssh/id_ed25519)
# - Passphrase: Use a strong passphrase (recommended for security)

# Start SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add your SSH key to the agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

#### **Step 2: Add Public Key to GitHub**

```bash
# Copy public key to clipboard:

# Linux:
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | xclip -selection clipboard

# macOS:
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Windows (Git Bash):
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | clip
```

**Manual Steps:**
1. Go to **GitHub → Settings → SSH and GPG keys**
2. Click **"New SSH key"**
3. **Title**: `"Work Laptop - [Your Name]"` (descriptive name)
4. **Key**: Paste your public key
5. Click **"Add SSH key"**

#### **Step 3: Test SSH Connection**

```bash
# Test connection to GitHub
ssh -T git@github.com

# Expected response:
# Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

# If you get permission denied, check:
ssh -vT git@github.com  # Verbose output for debugging
```

#### **Step 4: Use SSH for Repository Operations**

```bash
# Clone using SSH (not HTTPS)
git clone git@github.com:company/team-project.git

# Switch existing repository to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:company/team-project.git

# Verify remote URL
git remote -v
# Should show: git@github.com:company/team-project.git

# All operations now work without passwords
git push origin feature-branch  # No prompts!
git pull origin main           # Seamless!
```

https://github.com/company/awesome-project

Please:
1. Accept the GitHub invitation (check your email)
2. Set up SSH key authentication (see team wiki)
3. Clone the repository and let me know if you have any issues

Team SSH key requirements:
- Use Ed25519 keys with passphrases
- Name your key: 'work-laptop-[yourname]'
- Keys rotate every 90 days"

# 2. Team Member Response:
"Thanks! I've accepted the invitation and generated my SSH key.
Successfully cloned the repository and can see the codebase.
Ready to start on the authentication module."

# 3. Manager Follow-up:
"Great! You should see your SSH key listed in the team audit log.
Remember to follow our branching strategy (feature/your-name/feature-description).
Welcome to the team!"
```

## 🚀 **GitHub CLI - Modern Authentication**

### **📋 What is GitHub CLI?**

**GitHub CLI (gh)** is a modern command-line tool that:
- **Authenticates once** for all GitHub operations
- **Uses OAuth flow** (more secure than manual tokens)
- **Integrates Git + GitHub** features seamlessly
- **Perfect for team workflows** (PRs, issues, repositories)

### **🔧 GitHub CLI Setup**

#### **Step 1: Install GitHub CLI**

```bash
# Windows (using Windows Package Manager)
winget install --id GitHub.cli -e --source winget

# Windows (using Chocolatey)
choco install gh

# macOS (using Homebrew)
brew install gh

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh

# Verify installation
gh --version
```

#### **Step 2: Authenticate with GitHub**

```bash
# Start authentication process
gh auth login

# Follow the prompts:
# ? What account do you want to log into? → GitHub.com
# ? What is your preferred protocol for Git operations? → HTTPS
# ? Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? → Yes
# ? How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? → Login with a web browser

# Copy the one-time code shown, then press Enter
# Your browser will open - paste the code and authorize the application
```

#### **Step 3: Verify Authentication**

```bash
# Check authentication status
gh auth status

# Expected output:
# ✓ Logged in to github.com as your-username
# ✓ Git operations for github.com configured to use https protocol
# ✓ Token: *******************

# Test repository access
gh repo list your-username
```

## 🛡️ **Security Best Practices for Teams**

### **🔐 PAT Security Guidelines**

```bash
# ✅ DO:
# - Set expiration dates (30-90 days)
# - Use minimal required scopes
# - Create descriptive names
# - Rotate tokens regularly
# - Store in secure credential managers

# ❌ DON'T:
# - Commit PATs to code repositories
# - Share PATs between team members
# - Use overly broad scopes
# - Set "no expiration" for production use
# - Embed PATs in scripts without encryption
```

### **🔑 SSH Key Security Guidelines**

```bash
# ✅ DO:
# - Use Ed25519 keys (modern, secure)
# - Set strong passphrases on private keys
# - Use separate keys for different purposes
# - Regularly audit and rotate keys
# - Keep private keys secure (never share)

# ❌ DON'T:
# - Reuse personal SSH keys for work
# - Store private keys in cloud storage
# - Use RSA keys smaller than 4096 bits
# - Share private keys between team members
# - Skip passphrases (security risk)
```

### **🏢 Enterprise Security Requirements**

Many organizations require:

```bash
# Common enterprise policies:
- Two-factor authentication enabled
- SSH keys with passphrases
- PAT expiration ≤ 90 days
- Regular security training
- Audit logs for repository access
- VPN/network restrictions
- Approved device management
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Common Authentication Issues**

### **Issue 1: "Permission denied (publickey)"**

```bash
# Check SSH key is loaded
ssh-add -l

# If empty, add your key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Test with verbose output
ssh -vT git@github.com

# Check key permissions
ls -la ~/.ssh/
# Should be: 700 for ~/.ssh, 600 for private key, 644 for public key

# Fix permissions if needed
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### **Issue 2: "Authentication failed" with PAT**

```bash
# Verify PAT has correct scopes
# Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
# Check that 'repo' scope is selected for private repositories

# Clear credential cache
git config --global --unset credential.helper

# Or update stored credentials
git config --global credential.helper store
# Next Git operation will prompt for new credentials
```

### **Issue 3: "Repository not found" for team repo**

```bash
# Verify you've been added as collaborator
# Repository owner should see you in Settings → Manage access

# Check if invitation is pending
# Go to https://github.com/notifications or check email

# Verify repository URL
git remote -v
# Should match the repository you were invited to
```

### **Issue 4: GitHub CLI authentication expired**

```bash
# Check auth status
gh auth status

# Re-authenticate if needed
gh auth login --web

# Or refresh existing authentication
gh auth refresh
```

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Setup for Different Team Scenarios**

### **🔰 New Team Members (Beginner)**

```bash
# Recommended: Start with GitHub CLI
gh auth login
git clone https://github.com/company/team-project.git
# Simple, modern, handles everything automatically
```

### **👨‍💻 Daily Developers (Intermediate)**

```bash
# Recommended: SSH Keys for speed
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@company.com"
# Add public key to GitHub
git clone git@github.com:company/team-project.git
# Fast, secure, no password prompts
```

### **🏢 Enterprise Teams (Advanced)**

```bash
# Recommended: SSH + GitHub CLI combination
# SSH for Git operations (security)
# GitHub CLI for GitHub features (productivity)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-email@company.com"
gh auth login
# Best of both worlds
```
