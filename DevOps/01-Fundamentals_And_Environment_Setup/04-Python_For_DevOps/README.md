## 🚨 **START HERE FIRST: Python DevOps Q&A**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Before diving into any coding, complete the Q&A section to understand fundamental concepts:

### **📚 [`Python_DevOps_QA.md`](./Python_DevOps_QA.md)**
- **Purpose**: Answer beginner questions and clarify concepts
- **Topics**: Environment differences, VM usage, shell comparisons
- **Requirement**: Complete this before proceeding to subfolders
- **Validation**: Self-assessment checklist included

**Why start with Q&A?**
- Addresses common confusion points upfront
- Provides context for why certain practices exist
- Saves time by preventing common mistakes
- Builds conceptual foundation before hands-on work
