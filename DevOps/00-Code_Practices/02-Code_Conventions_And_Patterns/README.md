# Code Conventions and Patterns

## 📖 What This Section Does
Establish industry-standard coding patterns and conventions specifically for DevOps environments. Learn when and how to apply different programming patterns to create maintainable, scalable, and reliable DevOps code.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Master error handling patterns for resilient automation
- Implement async programming for efficient operations
- Apply configuration management patterns
- Integrate logging and monitoring into all code
- Design APIs following DevOps best practices
- Write comprehensive tests for infrastructure code
- Apply security coding practices throughout

## 📚 Pattern Categories

### **🔧 Core Patterns**
- **Error Handling** - Try/catch vs conditional logic, retry patterns, circuit breakers
- **Async Programming** - When to use async/await, parallel operations, handling I/O
- **Configuration Management** - Environment-specific configs, secrets management

### **📊 Observability Patterns**
- **Logging & Monitoring** - Structured logging, metrics collection, alerting
- **API Design** - RESTful APIs, error responses, rate limiting
- **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, infrastructure testing

### **🔒 Security Patterns**
- **Secure Coding** - Input validation, secret management, least privilege
- **Infrastructure Security** - Secure defaults, encryption, access controls

## 🛠️ Implementation Approach
Each pattern includes:
1. **When to use** - Specific DevOps scenarios
2. **How to implement** - Code examples in multiple languages  
3. **Common mistakes** - What to avoid
4. **Real-world examples** - Production-ready implementations
